# SFML game project

## How to build
1. Run Premake5 in cmd for your IDE
2. Build the project either in DebugDLL or ReleaseDLL
3. And you're done!

## Technology
This game is written in __C++__, using the __[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)__ library.

## First selfmade project
This project is my first ever game I have made by myself without using a tutorial, while using AI minimally.
